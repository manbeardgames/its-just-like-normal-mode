# Intemperance

Throughout the fight there are two times that the boss will use Intemperance. While both iterations of the phase are handled largly the same, the second time the phase occurs, players have to handle Gaoler's Flail at the same time. Due to this, I have split this document into two separate ones. You can view them by clicking the following
