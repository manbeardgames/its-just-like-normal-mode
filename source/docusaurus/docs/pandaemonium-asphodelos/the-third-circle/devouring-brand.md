# Devouring Brand
Devouring Brand is the first of a four part mechanic chain including, in order, **Seering Breeze**, **Left/Right Cinderwing**, and **Heart of Condemnation**.  Each mechanic will happen one after the other in series.  Positioning and movement of the party as one is key when performing this mechanic chain.  How we'll handle each one is outline in the sections below.


## Devouring Brand
When **Devouring Brand** starts, four fire line AoEs will spawn at the cardinal edges of the arena.  Over a small period of time, these fire lines will expand inward toward the center of the arena and converge in the middle.  As soon as all four lines meet in the middle, they will expand to be double in width.  

While **Devouring Brand** is being cast, all party members should move to the center of the arena to prepare for the next mechanic that follows.

## Experimental Fireplume
Immediatly following **Deviouring Brand** the boss will cast **Experimental Fireplume**.  Like before, this one can be on of the two variations; Large or Small Fireplumes.  However, for this one, we have to handle the mechanic while considering the fire lines that are converging toward the middle from **Devouring Brand**.  

- If it is a **Large Fireplume**, the party will move to the North East corner at the [A] waymark.  
- If it is the **Small Fireplumes**, the party will move to either the North East or North West corner depending on where the first explosion occurs.

:::caution
No matter which corner we move to, the party should move to the waymark position in that corner and stack together, not spread out. This is because of the next mechanic coming up.
:::

:::danger
The fire lines from **Devouring Brand** will converage around the same time that the fireplume fully resolves.  Keep this in mind since the width of the fire lines will double.

## Seering Breeze
After we finish with the fireplumes, the boss will cast **Searing Breeze**.  This will target all eight party members with point blank ground AoEs in the location they are standing.  If all party members are stacked together against the wall at the waymark after dodging the fireplumes, then this should eaisly bait all eight of the AoEs to the same location. Once the AoE indicators spawn on the ground, everyone should move in toward the center of the arena to dodge out of them.

:::danger
When moving out of the Searing Breeze AoEs, don't move into the fire lines from Devouring Brand, which will still be on the ground at this point.

## Left/Right Cinderwing
Next up, the boss will cast **Left/Right Cinderwing**.  Just like before, dodge to the left or right of the boss depending on which one it is using.  While moving to dodge left or right, all non-tank party members should also start making their way to the center of the arena. Tanks should stay up towards the wall to prepar for upcoming Heat of Condemnation.

The fire lines from devouring brand will no longer be on the ground at this point

## Heat of Condimnation
Two teathers will appear on a random non-tank party members.  Party should be stacked at the center of the arena at this point.  If you are not a tank, remember to stay stacked and don't move around until the tanks have grabbed both tethers and moved the safely to the opposite side of the boss (toward the wall). Once the tethers have resolved, tanks will need to make their way to the center of the arena with the party for the next mechanic.
