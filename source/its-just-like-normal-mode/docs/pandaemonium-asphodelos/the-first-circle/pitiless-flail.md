# Pitiless Flail of Grace/Purgation
Pitiless Flail of Grace/Purgation are tank busters that start with a heavy hitting knockback line AoE on the current tank and then followed up with **True Flare** or **True Holy** depending on if Grace or Purgation was used. The only way to know what the follow up will be is to pay attention to the name of the cast on the cast bar.  Both version are discussed in the sections below.

## Pitiless Flail of Grace
Pitiless Flail of Grace begins with a tank buster marker on the current tank.  When the cast finishes, the tank will be hit with a heavy hitting line AoE that also causes a knockback.  It will also apply a ![Magic Vulnerability Up](/img/icons/debuffs/magic-vulnerability-up.webp) **Magic Vulnerability Up** debuff on the tank.  This means that a tank swap is required so that the other tank can handle the follow up **True Holy** mechanic.

:::tip
As the current tank, you should attempt to aim it so the knockback knocks you toward the corner of the room. This is to ensure there is ample room for the knockback and it doesn't knock you into the wall, which will kill you.

If the tank swap was done successfully, the new current tank will need to stack with the party to resolve the **True Holy** follow up.  True Holy is a circle AoE targeted on the current tank that must be shared with other party members to split the damage.

## Pitiless Flail of Purgation
Just like with Grace, this begins with a tank buster matker on the current tank.  When the cast finishes, the tank will be hit with a a heavy hitting line AoE that also causes a knockback.  It will also apply a ![Magic Vulnerability Up](/img/icons/debuffs/magic-vulnerability-up.webp) **Magic Vulnerability Up** debuff on the tank.  This means that a tank swap is required so that the other tank can handle the follow up **True Flare** mechanic.

If the tank swap was done successfully, the new current tank will need to move away from the party to resolve the **True Flare** follow up.  True Flare is a proximity based explosion that will deals an amount of raid waid damage to the party based on the distance they are from the tank receiving the flare attack.
