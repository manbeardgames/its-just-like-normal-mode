# Shackles of Time
Shackles of Time will place the ![Shackles of Time](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-time.webp)**Shackles of Time** debuff on a random party member.  When the timer on the debuff expires, all tiles that have the same color as the one that party member is standing on will explode.

To handle this for our group, the party member that receives the debuff will always move to a red tile and the rest of the party will move to a green tile.

:::note
I choose to have the party member with the debuff go to a red tile because generally red = bad and green = good. Either way, whatever color you choose for your group, just be sure it's consistant for you group that they go to that color every time.
