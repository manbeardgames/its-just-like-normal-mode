# Lethe
Lethe is the enrage cast that the boss will use around 10 minutes into the fight.  If you don't kill the boss before this cast goes off, it's an instance raid wipe.

## Example Video
In this example video it shows the boss using Lethe. The party had pretty much wiped at this point but Gigren kept it going so we could see enrage for the first time.
