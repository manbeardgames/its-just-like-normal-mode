# Fourfold Shackles
Fourfold Shackles at first is an intimidating looking mechanic but is actually quite simple to solve.  When the boss finishes casting the ability, four random party members will receive the ![Shackles of Loneliness](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-loneliness.webp) **Shackles of Loneliness** debuff and the other four party party members will recieve the ![Shackles of Companionship](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-companionship.webp) **Shackles of Companionship** debuff.

![Fourfold Shackles Step One](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-first-circle/fourfold-shackles-step-one.webp)

Each set of these debuffs will have debuff timers of either 3 seconds, 8 seconds, 13 seconds, or 18 seconds.  This gives us a very clear order in which these debuffs will resolve. 

- Party members with ![Shackles of Companionship](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-companionship.webp) **Shackles of Companionship**, in order of the debuff timers from low to high, will go to the ![A](/img/icons/waymarks/a.webp), ![B](/img/icons/waymarks/b.webp), ![C](/img/icons/waymarks/c.webp), and ![D](/img/icons/waymarks/d.webp) waymarks.
- Party members with ![Shackles of Loneliness](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-loneliness.webp) **Shackles of Loneliness**, in order of the debuff timers from low to high, will go to the ![1](/img/icons/waymarks/one.webp), ![2](/img/icons/waymarks/two.webp), ![3](/img/icons/waymarks/three.webp), and ![4](/img/icons/waymarks/four.webp) waymarks.

![Fourfold Shackles Step Two](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-first-circle/fourfold-shackles-step-two.webp)

Party members should then remain on their respective waymarks until all four sets of debuff wear off and four sets of explosions happen.

:::tip
You can edit your HUD in game so that it shows your debuff separatly from your other buffs.  Then you can take this separate HUD element and make it really large and put it somewhere on your screen to make it more visible and eaiser to see which debuff you have the the amount of time on the debuff.
