# Aetherflail
Aetherflail is a mechanic that happens during the Shining Cells phase of the fight.  It combines a previouslys seen mechanic, [Gaoler's Flail](./gaolers-flail.md), with the boss also exploding either the red or green tiles on the floor with each flail swing.

:::tip
For the first Shining Cells phase, Aetherflail will always be either Left or Right combined with In or Out.  During the second Shining Cells phase however this can be any combination of the flails
:::

The images below is just one example of the variations that can occur. In this example, the boss would have the white orbs floating around him, indicating that the red tiles will be exploding.  He would have also dropped a sickle first on his left side, then the chakram/ring on his right side.  So we would move to the right side of the boss to dodge the sickle, say inside his hitbox to dodge the chakram, and stand on a green tile to avoid the aether explosions.

## Example Video
In this example video, the boss is using Aetherflail.  The orbs floating around him are the white orbs. He then drops a sickle on the right side and a mace on the left side.  This makes the solution for this variation left + out + red tile.
