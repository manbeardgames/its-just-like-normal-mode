# Gaoler's Flail
When the boss is casting Gaoler's Flail, he will bring out and drop two large weapons on his left and right side.  You need to not only recognize the type of weapon he drops on each side, **but also the order in which he brings them out** as this determines which happens first and which happens second.

## Weapon Types
### Sickle
The sickle will perform a 270 degree cleave on the side of the boss that the weapon dropped on.  To dodge this, just move to the opposite side.

### Mace
When using the mace, the boss will do a large point blank AoE around himself.  To dodge this, just move out away from the boss.

### Chakram (Ring)
When using a chakram (or ring), the boss will do a large donut AoE around himself.  To dodge this, just be inside his hitbox.

## Example Videos
### Double Sickle Example
In this example, the boss drops two sickle weapons, first on the left, then the second one on the right.  To handle this, first we dodge on the right side of the boss, then move to the left side to dodge the second sickle.

### Mace + Chakram Example
In this example, the boss drops the chakram weapon first on the right side, then the mace weapon on the left side.  We handle the chakram first by staying inside his hitbox, then move out to dodge the mace weapon.
