# Pandæmonium Asphodelos: The First Circle (Savage)

## Description
> The discovery of a crystal borne from the far reaches of the aetherial sea and the desperate plea contained within lead you once more to Elpis, where your trajectory quite literally collides with that of a young man named Themis. Like you, he is here for answers, seeking the source of an aetheric disturbance culminating in loss of contact with the gaol housing the ancients' most dangerous creations. It is this place─this Pandæmonium─into which you now descend... 

## Preface
**The documentation presented here is to cover major mechanics within the fight and how our static handles them.  There are always various ways to handle mechanics for these fights and some more preffered by the party finder community at large. When possible, I will offer alternate strategy suggestions, however explinations give in these documents are specific for our static.**

## Initial Setup
Before starting the fight, you'll need to setup a few things with the party in order to handle a few of the mechanics. 

### Clock Positions
The first thing you'll want to do is **clock spot** assignments.  Throw down the [1] waymark near the party and have everyone pick a spot on the N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW spots of the marker.

The image below shows the clock spot setup for our group.

### Waymarks
The next thing you'll want to setup is the waymarks on the arena. The following are the waymarks used by our group

![Waymarks](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-first-circle/waymarks.webp)

Let's go over why we have the waymarks setup this way.  They are really only used for the Aetherial Shackles and Fourfold Shackles mechanics to show clear positions for where people should stand.  During both of these mechanics, party members with the ![shackles of companionship](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-companionship.webp) **Shackles of Companionship**  debuff will be on the inner ![A](/img/icons/waymarks/a.webp), ![B](/img/icons/waymarks/b.webp), ![C](/img/icons/waymarks/c.webp), ![D](/img/icons/waymarks/d.webp) waymarks.  Party members with the ![shackles of loneliness](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-loneliness.webp) **Shackles of Loneliness**  debuff will be on the inner ![One](/img/icons/waymarks/one.webp), ![Two](/img/icons/waymarks/two.webp), ![Three](/img/icons/waymarks/three.webp), ![Four](/img/icons/waymarks/four.webp) waymarks.  Both of these, howeer, are discussed more in the respective documents.
