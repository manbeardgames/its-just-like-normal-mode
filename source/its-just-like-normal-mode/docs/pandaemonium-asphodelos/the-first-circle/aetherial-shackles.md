# Aetherial Shackles
When Aetherial Shackles is used two debuffs will be given out to two random party members.  These are

> ![Shackles of Lonlieness](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-loneliness.webp) **Shackles of Lonliness**: Marks the party member with the debuff and the three party members that are the furthest away from that party member with red chanins circling around them.  When the debuff resolves, all four of these party members will have large AoEs explode around them.

> ![Shackles of Companionship](/img/icons/debuffs/shackles-of-companionship.webp) **Shackles of Companionship**: Marks the party member with the debuff and the three party members that are the closest to them with purple chains.  When the debuff resolves, all four of these party members will have small AoEs explode around them.

In the example image below, the summoner and the astrologian are marked with the debuffs.

:::info
There is/was speculation going around early on that you can bait who gets the Shackles of Lonliness debuff by being the furthest party member away from the boss.  This is not true and does not work. The debuffs, both of them, are given to a random party member every time, there is no way to bait them.
:::

With a little bit of planning, handling this mechanic is actuall rather simple.  First, everyone should preposition on a [waymark](./index.md#waymarks) that in their [clock positions](./index.md#clock-positions)

![Aetherial Shackles Step Two](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-first-circle/aetherial-shackles-step-two.webp)

Next, we need to ensure that the party member with the **Shackles of Lonliness** (red debuff) is on an outer waymark and that the party member with the **Shackles of Companionship** (purple debuff) is on an inner waymark.  After moving to your clock positions, if you have have one of these debuffs but are not in the correct position to resolve it, then you swap positions with your partner.  **Your partner is the person that is on a waymark of the same color as your waymark**.  

In the image above, the Summoner has the purple debuff but their waymark position is at ![four](/img/icons/waymarks/four.webp) which is an outer waymark. Since purple debuff needs to be on an inner waymark, they will swap positions with the Scholar who is at ![d](/img/icons/waymarks/d.webp).  The same is true for the Astrologian, who has the red debuff, but thier waymark position is at ![B](/img/icons/waymarks/b.webp).  Since red debuff needs to be on an outer waymark, they will swap positions with the Reaper who is at ![2](/img/icons/waymarks/two.webp).  After swapping positions, they will be setup like shown below.

![Aetherial Shackles Step Three](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-first-circle/aetherial-shackles-step-three.webp)

With everyone in position, once the debuff timers run out, the mechanic resolves. 
- The party member with the Shackles of Companionship debuff and the three party members closest to them will have small AoE explosions happen where they stand.
- The party member with the Shackles of Loneliness debuff and the three party members that are the furthest from them will have large AoE explosions happen where they stand.

:::caution
When the debuffs resolve and the AoEs explode, each player recieves a ![Magic Vulnerability Up Debuff](/img/icons/debuffs/magic-vulnerability-up.webp) **Magic Vulnerability Up** debuff. This means that after taking the first hit, if they were to take another, the damage would be increased and will kill them.  Be sure that you position correctly so that you only take one explosion.

# Example Video
*in the example video, Gon and Edrael die. This is because they are standing too close to each other and their AoEs, even though they were the small purple ones, overlapped*
