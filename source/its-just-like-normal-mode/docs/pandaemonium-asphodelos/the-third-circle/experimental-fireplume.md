# Pand√¶monium Asphodelos: The Third Circle (Savage)
## Experimental Fireplume 
([Raid Plan Link](https://raidplan.io/plan/q9cEUVuj28if1R7b))

Experimental Fireplume has two variations that can be used based on the type of fireplume(s) (a.k.a ball(s)) that visuall spawn and fly up from the boss. This will either be a single **Large Fireplume** or several **Small Fireplumes**.  **Regardless of which variation is being used, all party members should be stacked in the center of the arena before the cast is finished**.

### Large Fireplume
The Large Fireplume variation is denoted by a single large ball of fire flying up from the boss.  When this variation occurs, **one player is targeted for the fireplume to drop on**, however there is no indication or marker to identify the player.  Due to this, everyone should be standing in the center of the arena before the cast bar finishes to ensure that it is baited to the center in case we get this variation.

When the fireplume lands, the AoE that is created is massive, filling almost the entire arena, except for the outside edges if baited properly.  All players should move to the edge of the arena to dodge it.

:::note
If the first Experimental Fireplume is a Large Fireplume variation, all party members should run to the wall directly North.  This makes it much eaiser to dodge the next mechanic that that boss uses (Left/Right Cinderwing).

### Small Fireplumes
The Small Fireplumes variation is denoted by several small fireballs rotating around the boss before flying up.  When this variation occurs, four sets of explosions will occur, rotating around the edge of the arena, with a final explosion in the center of the arena.  To properly handle this mechanic, players should wait until the second explosion occurs, then move out of the center and into the space where the first and second explosions overlapped.

The following image give one example of the explosion pattern that can occur.

:::note
The explosion sets do not always start North and South first. Be ready for this.
