# Experimental Fireplume 
This mechanic has two variations; **Large Fireplume** or **Small Fireplumes**.  Which one is being used is based on the animation from the boss.  If a single large ball of fire spawns on the boss and flys upward, it is the **Large Fireplume** variation.  If, instead, it is several small fire balls that spawn around the boss and then fly up, it is the **Small Fireplumes** variation.

:::danger
No matter which variation is behing used, all party members should be stacked in the middle of the arena before the cast is finished.  This is because of how the large fireplume variation works, explained below.
:::

## Large Fireplume
When it is a large fireplume, the position of one random party member is used as the location that the fireplume will drop on.  When the fireplume drops, it will create a large circular explosion covering most of the arena.  If dropped in the middle of the arena, the outer edge of the arena will be safe.

:::tip
When running to the edge of the arena for this one, try to always run either directly north or directly south.  This makes the follow up mechanic significantly eaiser to resolve for yourself.  If you're a melee, you'll definitely want to run north to keep uptime on the boss.
:::

## Small Fireplumes
When it is the small fireplumes variation, four sets of explosions will occur around the outer edge of the arena.  These explosions will occur two at a time, opposite each other, and rotate around the room clockwise for the next set.  After the four sets of explosions have finished, a final fifth explosion will occur in the center of the arena.  To resolve this, party members should wait in the middle of the arena until the second explosion set has occured.  Then run immediatly to the edge of the arena where the first and second explosion sets overlapped.

:::note
The explosion sets do not always start North and South first. Be ready for this.
