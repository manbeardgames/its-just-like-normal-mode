# Left/Right Cinderwing
The boss will do a half room cleave on the side denoted by the cast name.  Just move to the opposite side of the boss.

:::caution
The cleave comes from the boss and the direction the boss is facing is important. Be careful when dodging this if the boss is turned in a way that you are not expecting.
