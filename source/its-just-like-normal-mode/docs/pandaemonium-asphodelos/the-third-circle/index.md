# Pandæmonium Asphodelos: The Third Circle (Savage)

## Description
> Having successfully subdued the hippokampos, your group sets out to find Erichthonios's fellow warders, presumed to be hiding in the deepest circles of Asphodelos. Standing in your way, however, is the phoinix, a violent failed iteration of the iconic immortal bird. It soars through halls warped by creation magicks into an arid, desolate wasteland─its perfect choice of battlefield─awaiting any foolish enough to venture into its newfound domain...
