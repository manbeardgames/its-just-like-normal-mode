# Heat of Condemnation
This will spawn two tethers on a random non-tank party member.  When the mechanic resolves, the players that are being targeted with the tethers will receive heavy hitting tank busters and also create an explosion AoE around them.  To resolve this mechanic, first party members should stack behind the boss.  This allows both tethers to be going to the same general location.  Next, the tanks will need to move in and grab the tethers from the party members, then take them to the opposite side of the boss, away from each other, for the resolution.

:::tip
For our group, Ryu has asked all party members to stand on the south west flank of the boss in order to accomodate his tether grab.
:::

:::caution
To ensure that tethers are eaisly picked up by the tanks, the other party members should not be moving around until both tanks have the tethers and have moved to the opposite side of the boss.
