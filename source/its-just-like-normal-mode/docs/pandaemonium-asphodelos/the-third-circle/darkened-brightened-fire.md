# Darkened Fire + Brightened Fire

This is a two part mechanic that requires the party to drop Darkend Fire add spawns at a specific locations, then hit each of the spawns with a Brightened Fire in order to remove their debuffs so they can be damaged.

## Darkened Fire
This will target either the tanks and healers or it will target all four DPS.  Since there is no indicator as to who is being targeted for this, partners will have to be used.  Each tank and healer will need to be paird with a DPS.  When the cast is resolved, four Darkened Fire adds will spawn at the position of the partymembers that were targeted.  Each Darkened Fire add will have 4 stacks of the Darkened Fire buff, making them invulnerable to damage unless all 4 stacks of the debuff are removed. 

To make things eaiser, the darkened fires should be spawned in the same locations they are spawned in Normal Mode.  This would be the small squares at the corners of the inner square of the arena.  See the image below for visual indication.

:::note
For our group, we are using our default partner system for the pairs here.  This would be clock spots, but with the tanks and healers rotated clockwise for their DPS partners.

```
[H1][R1]          [MT][R2]
          [Boss]
[OT][M1]          [H2][M2]
```

## Brightened Fire
Immediatly after the Darkened Fire adds are spawned, all eight party members will be targeted for **Brightened Fire**.  This is indicated by the whtie AoE circle indicator that appears below a player.  Each player will also receive dots above their head, numbering from 1 to 8.  The boss will attack each player, one at a time, in the order of dot count, with Brightened Fire.  This attack will deal a small amount of damage and place a short fire vulnerablity debuff on the player.  However, it will also remove 1 stack of the Darkened Fire debuff from a Darkened Fire add that is hit with it. This menas that the mechanic needs to be resolved in such a way that all four Darkened Fires are hit a total of four times each.

To do this, players should stand on waymarks 1 - 4 based on their dot count above their heads.

- 1 and 5 count should stand on waymark [1]
- 2 and 6 count should stand on waymark [2]
- 3 and 7 count should stand on waymark [3]
- 4 and 8 count should stand on waymark [4]

Even though players receive the fire vulnerability debuff when hit, we can stack players together like this because the debuff timer is short and will fall off before they are hit a second time.

Once all eight players have been hit by the Brightened Fire, they will need to quickly kill the Darkened Fire adds before they enrage and explode. If one explodes, the party can survive providing they were shielded, but all members will receive a damage down.  If two or more explode, it will be a raid wipe.

:::tip
There is an alternate method of handling the Brightened Fire placements that requires more movement, but is less healing for healers.  To do this alternate version, have dot counts 1 through 4 stand on the waymarks, and 5 through 8 stand in the center of the arena.  Then, as the Brightened Fire attacks are going out, 1 and 5 will swap places, 2 and 6 will swap places, etc.  

I do not recommend this strategy, and it is not used by our group, but offering it as an alternative method if healing is an issue here.
