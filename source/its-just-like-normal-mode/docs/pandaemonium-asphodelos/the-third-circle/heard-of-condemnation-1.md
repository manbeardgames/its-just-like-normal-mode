# Pand√¶monium Asphodelos: The Third Circle (Savage)
## Heart of Condemnation #1

[Raid Plan Link](https://raidplan.io/plan/E_GO5teZrVykMS-e)

Two tethers will appear on two random party memberss.  When the mechanic resolves, heaving hitting AoEs will hit the two players who have the teathers.  To resolve this, the entire party will stack on the **South West** flank behind the boss.  Both tanks will then move in to grab a tether and take them to the opposite side of the boss from the party.

The **Main Tank** will take their tether to the left and the **Off Tank** will take their tether to the right.

:::caution
To ensure that tethers are eaisly picked up by the tanks, the other party members should not be moving around until both tanks have the tethers and have moved to the opposite side of the boss.
