# Adds Phase
During the adds phase, the party will need to be split up into two light parties consiting of one tank, one healer, and two dps each.  The adds phase from beginning to end happens in three parts and is a tight DPS check as well as a tight healing check.  Each part of the fight is broken down in the sections below.

## Sunbirds
At the start of the add phase, the boss will begin with a heavy hitting raid wise.  Healers need to ensure party is topped off before this hits and heal up after.  Once the raid wide damage goes off, four Subird adds will spawn around the cardinals of the boss.

- The tank from **Group 1** will grab the North and East sunbirds and take them both to the North wall.
- The tank from **Group 2** will grab the South and West sunbirds and take them both to the South wall.

Each light party will then need to kill one sunbird, and only one, at the wall where their tank takes it.  Once the sunbird for that group has been killed, the tank should rotate clockwise to the next cardinal wall.

If done correctly, this should leave only one dead Sunbird in the North, South, East, and West walls of the arena respectivly.  

:::note
For healers, througout this phase, the boss is "raining fire" down from above with anability called **Blazing Rain**.  This will deal moderate amounts of damage to the party each time and occurs roughly every 8 seconds. Be sure to keep up on heals with regens so that the upcoming raid wides don't catch you off guard.

## Sunbird Revival + Tethers
After all sunbirds are dead, the party should meat up in the middle of the arena to receive healing top ups and an shields and mitigation that can be provided.  The boss will then use **Flames of Undeath** which is another heaving hitting raid wide that will also revive all the sunbirds that died.  When they are reviving, they will telegraph large AoE circles underneath the.  There is no damage that comes from these circles, however if any one sunbird's circle overlaps with another sunbird, then they will receive a buff.  This is why we killed them spaced apart before.

After the sunbirds are revived, each sunbird will then tether to a random party member, and that party member will then be tethered to one of the other party members.  After a short period, the sunbirds will the dash to the party member that they are tethered too and then dash a second time to the next party member in the tether chain.

The tethers are the typical purple proximity tethers we see in past fights.  This means the tether will need to be stretch out in order to not be killed by it. On top of this, when a party member is hit by a sunbird, they will receive a vulnerability debuff making it an instant kill if they are hit by a second sunbird.  Thankfully, there is a simple solution to solving this tether mechanic.

1. If you are tethered to a sunbird, take your tether across the arena to the opposite sunbird, then move **clockwise** from that bird.
2. For those that are tethered to a party member only, take your tether across teh arena to the bird opposite the party member your are tethered too, then move **counter-clockwise** from that bird.

If everyone is positioned correctly, the tethers will look something like the following.

:::tip
The sunbirds are vulnerable to taking damage as soon as they respawn. So start hitting them while resolving tethers, keep hitting them while waiting for tethers to resolve, don't stop hitting them.

:::tip
If you look in the image, there is plenty of room in the intercardinals between the birds.  You can use all of this space for your tethers if things get weird while positioning.  However, keep in mind that the positions in the image set every party member right next to a sunbird, which means uptime for you melees that want your uptime.

## Kill Revived Sunbirds
After the tethers have resolved, each light party group will then need to kill their birds once again one bird per cardinal.  Handle this exactly the same way we handled the sunbirds before

- **Group 1** will kill one bird on the North wall, then rotate clockwise and kill the second bird at the East wall
- **Group 2** will kill one bird on the South wall, then rotate clockwise and kill the second bird at the West wall


Once the sunbirds have been killed, the boss will **Flames of Undeath** one more time, so be sure to heal up and prepare for it.  Just like before this will cause the sunbirds to revive, only this time as some weird floating teeth looking things. I dunno bro, it's some horror shit happening here.  They will telegraph large circles as before, and if any of them overlap another one, then they buff the boss.

After this, the boss will begin channeling and casting **Dead Rebirth**. The boss becomes retargetable at this time.  Healers be sure to top up and shield for Dead Rebirth, other party members should also provide mitigation through addle/feint/shake/etc.
