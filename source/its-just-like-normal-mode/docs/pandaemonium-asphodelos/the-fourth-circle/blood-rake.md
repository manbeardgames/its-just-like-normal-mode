# Blood Rake (Overview)
This is the first mechanic we'll see in the fight and it has multiple parts that have to be handled.  Each part is listed in order in the sections below.  As an overview though, I think it's important to understand the *why* of the mechanic instead of just the *how*.  So for a quick overview of whats happening, the boss will absorb the aether from four party members, two sepearte times.  The mechanics that follow will then reuse the aether he absorded to deal damage. The mechanics has to be resolved in such a way that when if a party member is handling a mechanic, it is for one that their aether is not being used on.

:::note
For this page, any time I need to refer to both tanks and healers as one group, I will refer to them as **supports**.

## Blood Rake
Blood Rake will target four party members, and it will always either be all four supports or all four dps.  When Blood Rake is used on these party members, their aether is absorbed to be reused by the boss for a future mechanic.

1) The first Blood Rake, the boss wills store the aether *in his cloak* immediatly after absorbing it by using **Aetheric Chlamys**.  This is later released in the form of four tethers called **Inversive Chlamys**
2) The second Blood Rake, the boss does not store it, instead he will immediatly use it for **Director's Belone** which we'll refer to going forward as the **Role Call Debuff**.

:::info
Fun fact, **Chlamys** is a word used to describe a short cloak. These were worn by mean in ancient Greece until around the 12th century AD
:::

So based on the information above, this means the party members that are targetted for the first Blood Rake **cannot** take the tethers and the party members targeted for the second Blood Rake **cannot** have the Role Call debuff.
