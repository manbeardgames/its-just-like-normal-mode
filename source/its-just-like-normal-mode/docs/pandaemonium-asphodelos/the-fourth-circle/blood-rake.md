# Blood Rake (Overview)
This is the first mechanic we'll see in the fight and it has multiple parts that have to be handled.  Each part is listed in order in the sections below.  As an overview though, I think it's important to understand the *why* of the mechanic instead of just the *how*.  So for a quick overview of whats happening, the boss will absorb the aether from four party members, two sepearte times.  The mechanics that follow will then reuse the aether he absorded to deal damage. The mechanics has to be resolved in such a way that when if a party member is handling a mechanic, it is for one that their aether is not being used on.

:::note
For this page, any time I need to refer to both tanks and healers as one group, I will refer to them as **supports**.  
:::

## Blood Rake
Blood Rake will target four party members, and it will always either be all four supports or all four dps.  When Blood Rake is used on these party members, their aether is absorbed to be reused by the boss for a future mechanic.

1. The first Blood Rake, the boss wills store the aether *in his cloak* immediatly after absorbing it by using **Aetheric Chlamys**.  This is later released in the form of four tethers called **Inversive Chlamys**
2. The second Blood Rake, the boss does not store it.  Instead he will immediatly use it for **Director's Belone** which we'll refer to going forward as the **Role Call**.

:::info
Fun fact, **Chlamys** is a word used to describe a short cloak. These were worn by men in ancient Greece until around the 12th century AD
:::

So based on the information above, this means the party members that are targetted for the first Blood Rake **cannot** take the tethers and the party members targeted for the second Blood Rake **cannot** have the Role Call debuff. 

## Role Call (Director's Belone)
After the second Blood Rake occurs, the boss will cast **Director's Belone**.  This will place the ![Role Call Debuff Icon](/img/icons/debuffs/role-call.webp) **Role Call** debuff on 1 random tank, 1 random healer, and 2 random dps.  THis debuff works like other virus type debuffs in that you can pass it to another player by stacking with them.  If a player passes their Role Call debuff to another player, after passing it, they will receive the ![Miscast Debuff Icon](/img/icons/debuffs/miscast.webp) **Miscast** debuff, which prevents them from receiving the Role Call debuff back.

When the Role Call debuff expires, it will deal leathal damage if the player with the debuff had their aether absorbed during the second Blood Rake. Because of how Blood Rake targets party members, this means either all supports will need the Role Call debuff or all DPS will need it. The trick here is how to handle passing the debuff to the correct people.  The following will cover both scenarios.

### Supports Need Debuffs
The supports will only need the debuff if they were **NOT** targeted for second Blood Rake.  To handle, this, we'll have all DPS stack together on top of each other south of the boss, while the supports line up on the north side of the boss.  This will create a *heard immunity* effect with the DPS where the Role Call debuff will be swapped between the DPS creating a situation where two of them have the Role Call debuff and the other two have the Miscast Debuff.  Next, the healer that needs the Role Call debuff will run into the DPS stack to get the debuff, then move out of the stack.  Once they are out, the tank that needs the Role Call debuff will move into the DPS stack to grab the remaining one and then move out.

![Supports Need Debuff Step Three](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/role-call/supports-step-three.webp)

:::caution
The healer and tank should be careful when moving in to grab the debuff and then moving out.  If the healer grabs the debuff then accidently passes it to the tank, this means the healer will get the Miscast debuff and will not be able to grab the other one. Take care in how you move.

### DPS Need Debuffs
The DPS will only need the debuff if they were **NOT** targeted for the second blood rake.  To handle this scenarios, we'll have all the supports stack together on top of each other north of the boss, while the DPS lien up on teh south side of the boss.  This will create a *heard immunity* effect with the supports where the Role Call debuff will be swapped between the supports creating a situation where two fo them will have the Role Call debuff and the other two will have the Miscast Debuff.  Next, one of the dps that needs the Role Call debuff will run into the support stack to get teh debuff, then move out of the stack.  Once they are out, the other dps that needs the Role Call debuff will move into the support stack to grab the remaining one and then move out.

![DPS Need Debuff Step Two](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/role-call/dps-step-two.webp)
![DPS Need Debuff Step Three](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/role-call/dps-step-three.webp)

:::caution
The two dps should be careful when moving in to grab the debuff and then moving out.  If the first dps grabs the debuff then accidently passes it to the other dps, this means the first dps will get the Miscast debuff and will not be able to grab the other one. Take care in how you move.

## Tethers (Inversive Chlamys)
Shortly after the Role Call debuffs are sent out, the boss will begin casting **Inversive Chlamys** and four tethers will appear on four random party members.  At the end of this cast, the boss will hit the party members that are tetherd with smallish point blank AoEs using the aether he absorbed during the first Blood Rake.  This means the only party members that can take these tethers are those that did **NOT** get targeted during the first Blood Rake.  Just like with Role Call, this means either the four supports will take the tethers or the four dps.  

To make passing tethers as smooth as possible, party members should already be in their two groups from where we handled Role Call.  This means all supports should be on the North side of the boss, and all dps should be on the south side of the boss.  Then whichever group needs to grab the tethers should all move int directly under the boss and wiggle around a little to ensure tether grab, then move out back to their side of the boss to spread the tethers. 

Each scenario is covered below.

### Supports Need Tethers
The supports will only need to take the tethers if they were **NOT** targeted for the second blood rake.  To handle this scenario, after the party deals with Role Call, all supports should stack together under the boss.  Once the tethers appear, they will wiggle around a little bit to ensure they grab the tethers, then move out back out the north side of the boss to their assigned positions with their tether. All DPS should remain on the south side of the boss to ensure they do not accidently grab a tether and/or get cliped from the explosions. Refer to the images below for handling this and the assigned positions.
