## Pinax (Overview)
During this part of the fight, the boss will transition the room to create four tiles, one in each qudrant of the room. The tiles are:

- Lightning: Deals proximity damage with the epicenter being the center of the room
- Water: Does a knockback from the center of the room
- Fire: Does 2 AoE targeted on healers. Damage must be shraed by light parties.
- Poison: Does a point blank AoE on every party member.  Each party member can only take one, so don't overlap them.

When the boss casts **Pinax**, this will trigger two of the tiles to perform their mechanics back to back.  The first tile will always be either Lightning or Water, and the second tile wil always be either Fire or Posion.  All possible combinations are

- Lightning then Fire (Proximity damage then group stacks)
- Lighning then Poision (Proximity damage then spreads)
- Water then Fire (Knockback then group stacks)
- Water then Poision (Knockback then spreads)

As each tile's mechanic is resolved, the tile itself will also explode, so party members cannot be standing inside the tile.

## Uptime Strat
Aether party finder has adopted an uptime strat that is relitvely safe and easy to perform.  This strat relies on three basic ground rules; Boss Position, Fire Stack Positions, and Posion Spred Positions.  Once you remember these three rules, the rest of the mechanics happen around them. Below you can find a video talk through of the uptime strat as well as a link to the toolbox used in the video.  Below these you will find the text guide for the mechanic as well if you'd rather refer to it.

### Boss Position
The first ground rule for uptime is the boss position. The main tank should move the boss so that he sits between the lightning and fire tiles with the boss facing the wall.  When the boss is casing **Pinax**, he will not move, so this gives us an anchor point to handle the tile mechanics safely.

### Fire Stack Positions
The fire tile mechanic requires that we split the party into two light groups to handle the stack damae that each group will get.  For this, we're going to position Group 1 on the front side of the boss and Group 2 on the back side of the boss.  

![Pinax Fire Stack Positions](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/pinax/pinax-fire-stack-positions.webp)

### Poison Spread Positions
The poison tile requires that party members spread out, as each party member will be hit with a smallish point blank AoE.  To handle this spread and still provide uptime for melee, we'll use the following spread positions

- Main tank will position in front of the boss against the wall.
- Off tank will position in the center of the bosses hitbox.
- Melee DPS will position on the left and right side of the boss
- Healers will position against the wall directly above the center circle on the tiles.
    - One healer on the lightning tile
    - One healer on the fire tile.
- The ranged DPS will position in the corners of the fire tile.

The following image shows how these spreads should look

### Lightning + Fire
Lightning deals proximity AoE damage based on distance from the center of the room.  However, this does not mean we have to move all the way to the corner. Instead, the party will stack against the wall at the front side of the boss on the fire tile.  Once the lightning tile has resolve, the party will then move over to the lightning tile and into their fire stack positions.

![Pinax Lightning & Fire Step Two](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/pinax/pinax-lightning-fire-step-two.webp)

### Lightning + Poison
Lightning deals proximity AoE damage based on distance from the center of the room.  However, this does not mean we have to move all the way to the corner. Instead, the party will stack against the wall at the front side of the boss on the fire tile.  Once the lightning tile has resolve, the party will then move into their poison spread positions that we established beforehand.

![Pinax Lightning & Poison Step Two](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/pinax/pinax-lightning-poison-step-two.webp)

### Water + Fire
Water will cause a knockback from the center of the room on all party members.  When dealing with **Water + Fire**, party members will want to position themselves so that they are knocked back against the wall on the front side of the boss.  After the knockback is resolved, party members move into their fire stack positions.

![Pinax Water & Fire Step Two](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/pinax/pinax-water-fire-step-two.webp)

### Water + Poison
Water will cause a knockback from the center of the room on all party members.  WHen dealing with **Water + Poison**, party members willw ant to position themselves so that they are knockbacked back relative to their poison spread positions.

:::danger
Be careful of how you knockback if you are a healer or ranged DPS. You want to knockback relativly close to your spread position, but you do not want the knockback to push you through the center circle of a tile. Passing through the center circle of a tile is dangerous and needs to be avoided.  You have time to move into position after knockback, just get close to your position.

### Cardinal Shifts
During tiles, the boss will use either **Northern, Easterly, Southern, or Westerly Shift**.  This name of the mechanic indicates at which cardinal direction of the arena the boss will jump too.  The boss will also have either his **Cape** or his **Sword** glowing.  This indicates the attack he will use when he jumps.

- Cape means he will do a heavy knockback
- Sword means he will do a massive cleave inwards toward the arena.

![Pinax Cardinal Cape](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/pinax/pinax-cardinal-shift-cape.webp)

Cardinal shift will also always be combined with either a Lightning or Water tile  This is where we'll use our anit-knockbacks and I'm going to highlight it by putting it in a highlight section below, so please read

:::note
During Cardinal Shift, if it is the **Water Tile** and/or if the boss is using **Cape**, this is where we will us our anti-knockback.  While not 100% needed for water tile here since we can just knockback to the wall where we need to be, it is 100% needed for the **Cape** in order to maintain uptime for the uptime strat.  Anti-knockback should be used about 2/3 into the Cardinal Shift cast bar.
:::

It's also important to highlight the order of events here for cardinal shift.  The table below has the general timeline of events starting from the first tile

| Mechanic | Cast | Effect |Information |
|----------|------|--------|------------|
| Water/Lightning Pinax | 00:00 | 00:09 | This will either be the water or the lightning tile |
| Cardinal Shift | 00:04 | 00:12 | Either the cape or sword |
| Fire/Poison Pinax | 00:11 | 00:20 | This will either be the fire or poison tile |

So we get either Water or Lightning.  The 3 seconds after that the cardinal shift will resolve.  Then 8 seconds after that the Fire/Posion will resolve.  I want to repeat that, **8 seconds** after is when the fire/poison resolves.  This is important to understand in regards to how we'll handle this to maintain uptime; that there is plenty of time, roughly 3 GCDs, for the MT to position the boss so we can handle the Fire/Poison tile.

I'm not going to cover every possible configuration of shift + lightning/water + fire/posion below.  For the most part, just handle them as you would expect while maintining uptime. However, I do want to cover a couple of scenarios to that highlight some things and also cover some edge cases for alternate positionings.

### Cardinal Shift: Fire Tile
During Cardinal Shift, regardless of what the first tile is, if the second one is the **Fire** tile, then the Main Tank needs to pull the boss off the wall so we can move into our fire stack positions.  Remember, there is plenty of time after the Cardinal Shift mechanic occurs, 8 seconds, roughly 3 GCDS to move the boss.  The main tank will just back the boss up toward the center of the arena to make space on the back side of the boss.  Then Group 1 will stack on the front side of the boss and Group 2 on the back side of the boss for the fire stacks.

 ### Cardinal Shifts: Worse Scenario Posion Tile
 There is one possible scenario that can occur with the **Posion** tile that is the absolute worst case scenario.  Ultimatly we'll handle it the same way as we have before, with a slight adjustment to the spread positions. 

 So for this scenario, lets say the boss does Lightning Tile + Westerly Shift + Poision Tile, and in the tile setups, the lightning tile is North West and the poison tile is South West. We would handle the Lightning tile by moving to the west wall and stacking on the posion tile.  After the cardinal shift resolves, the main tank will then need to pull the boss off the wall toward the center of the arean, just like with the fire tile stuff mentioned above.  Then, since the posion tile is below us, our spread positions would adjust to the following


![Pinax Cardinal Posion Worst Case Scenario](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/pinax/pinax-cardinal-poision-worst-scenario.webp)

:::caution
Remember that in this scenario that you do not want to be standing on the posion tile as it'll explode. This is especially important for both tanks and the melee that stacks underneath the boss.
