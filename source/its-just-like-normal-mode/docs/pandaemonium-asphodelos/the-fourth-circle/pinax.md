## Pinax (Overview)
During this part of the fight, the boss will transition the room to create four tiles, one in each qudrant of the room. The tiles are:

- Lightning: Deals proximity damage with the epicenter being the center of the room
- Water: Does a knockback from the center of the room
- Fire: Does 2 AoE targeted on healers. Damage must be shraed by light parties.
- Poison: Does a point blank AoE on every party member.  Each party member can only take one, so don't overlap them.

When the boss casts **Pinax**, this will trigger two of the tiles to perform their mechanics back to back.  The first tile will always be either Lightning or Water, and the second tile wil always be either Fire or Posion.  All possible combinations are

- Lightning then Fire (Proximity damage then group stacks)
- Lighning then Poision (Proximity damage then spreads)
- Water then Fire (Knockback then group stacks)
- Water then Poision (Knockback then spreads)

As each tile's mechanic is resolved, the tile itself will also explode, so party members cannot be standing inside the tile.

## Uptime Strat
Aether party finder has adopted an uptime strat that is relitvely safe and easy to perform.  This strat relies on three basic ground rules; Boss Position, Fire Stack Positions, and Posion Spred Positions.  Once you remember these three rules, the rest of the mechanics happen around them. Below you can find a video talk through of the uptime strat as well as a link to the toolbox used in the video.  Below these you will find the text guide for the mechanic as well if you'd rather refer to it.

### Boss Position
The first ground rule for uptime is the boss position. The main tank should move the boss so that he sits between the lightning and fire tiles with the boss facing the wall.  When the boss is casing **Pinax**, he will not move, so this gives us an anchor point to handle the tile mechanics safely.

### Fire Stack Positions
The fire tile mechanic requires that we split the party into two light groups to handle the stack damae that each group will get.  For this, we're going to position Group 1 on the front side of the boss and Group 2 on the back side of the boss.

### Poison Spread Positions
The poison tile requires that party members spread out, as each party member will be hit with a smallish point blank AoE.  To handle this spread and still provide uptime for melee, we'll use the following spread positions

- Tanks will position on the front and back side of the boss
- Melee DPS will position on the left and right side of the boss
- Healers will position against the wall directly above the center circle on the tiles.
    - One healer on the lightning tile
    - One healer on the fire tile.
- The ranged DPS will position in the corners of the fire tile.

The following image shows how these spreads should look

### Lightning + Fire
Lightning deals proximity AoE damage based on distance from the center of the room.  However, this does not mean we have to move all the way to the corner. Instead, the party will stack against the wall at the front side of the boss on the fire tile.  Once the lightning tile has resolve, the party will then move over to the lightning tile and into their fire stack positions.

### Lightning + Poison
Lightning deals proximity AoE damage based on distance from the center of the room.  However, this does not mean we have to move all the way to the corner. Instead, the party will stack against the wall at the front side of the boss on the fire tile.  Once the lightning tile has resolve, the party will then move into their poison spread positions that we established beforehand.

![Pinax Lightning & Poison Step Two](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/pinax/pinax-lightning-poison-step-two.webp)

### Water + Fire
Water will cause a knockback from the center of the room on all party members.  When dealing with **Water + Fire**, party members will want to position themselves so that they are knocked back against the wall on the front side of the boss.  After the knockback is resolved, party members move into their fire stack positions.

![Pinax Water & Fire Step Two](/img/pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/pinax/pinax-water-fire-step-two.webp)

### Water + Poison
Water will cause a knockback from the center of the room on all party members.  WHen dealing with **Water + Poison**, party members willw ant to position themselves so that they are knockbacked back relative to their poison spread positions.

:::danger
Be careful of how you knockback if you are a healer or ranged DPS. You want to knockback relativly close to your spread position, but you do not want the knockback to push you through the center circle of a tile. Passing through the center circle of a tile is dangerous and needs to be avoided.  You have time to move into position after knockback, just get close to your position.
