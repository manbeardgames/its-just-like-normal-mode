## Akanthai Act 1 (Overview)
During this part of the fight, the boss will spawn 8 towers in an X pattern around the middle of the arena, along with 4 large AoEs that are coming from the cardinal edges of the arena.  After a couple of seconds, the towers and AoE telegraphs removed and replaced with large thors that the boss drops in their place.   The boss will tether to the thorns to show the order of mechanics; first tethering to 2 of the cardinal thorns, then to the 8 tower thorns, and finally to the remaining 2 cardinal thorns.  After this, the thorns will resolve there mechanics in order.

- The cardinal thorns will do a large point blank AoE from the center of the thorn
- The tower thorns must be soaked by one party member each, otherwise they will explode doing raid wide damage and most likely a raid wipe.

Resolving this mechanic comes down to recognizing which 2 of the cardinal AoEs will explode first, then doing a dance around the boss to get towers and finally dodge the final 2 AoE thorns.  The sections below will outline our strat for doing this.

## The Setup
The first thing we need to do for this mechanic is define how we're going to split the party up to handle the 8 towers.  In order to keep uptime, we need to establish that tanks and melee should be on the towers toward the center of the areana, with ranged and healers on the outside towers.  This would mean that the party splits will be 

- Light Party 1: Tanks + Healers
- Light Party 2: DPS

To also keep things consitant for our group, we'll have the following priorities for safe positions

- Tanks + Healers have North and East priority
- DPS have South and West priority

Knowing this setup, we can now determine that for towers, we will have the following positional setups

If the first safe spots are on the North and South side of the arena (meaning the first two towers tethered too were East and West) then the following is our tower setup

Otherwise, if the first safe spots on on the East and West side of the arena (meaning the first two towers tetehred were Norht and South) then the following is our tower setup.

## The Strat

:::note
In the following exmaples for this strat, I'll be showing N/S safe first.  If E/W is safe first, it's the same strat, the party just rotates clockwise
:::

First we wait to see which cardinal throns the boss tethers too.  **These will always be either North and South or East and West**.  These will be the first to explode.  In this example, he is tethering first to the East and West cardinal thorns.

Once we know which cardinals will explode first, the party can then move into the safe spots.  Going by the example above, if the East and West thorns are exploding first, then the party splits into light parties on the North and South.

The first pair of cardinal thorns will then resolve, doing large point blank AoEs from the center of the thorns.

After the AoE explosions go off, party members will need to quickly move into their tower positions to soak the towers.

Once towers have resolved, everyone moves to the next safe cardinal positions to dodge the final two cardinal thorn explosions
