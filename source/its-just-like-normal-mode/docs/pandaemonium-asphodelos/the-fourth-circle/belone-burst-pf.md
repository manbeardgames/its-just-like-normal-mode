## Belone Burst (Overview)
**Belone Burst** is the name of the mechanic that is the second part of a two part mechanic. The first part is called **Vengeful Belone**.  During this, players will be marked with an **Acting-[Role]** debuff where [Role] is either Tank, Healer or DPS. Then eight orbs will spawn around the arena, tethering to the closest player to them.  Each orb is designated a role based on the role of the person it tethers too, so an orb tethered to a tank is a tank orb, an orb tethered to a dps is a dps orb, etc.  

All 8 orbs must be popped and soaked by two party members each and will do a small AoE explosion around them when they are popped. Not only this, but party members can only pop an orb that is of a role differing from the **Acting-[Role]** debuff that they have recieved.  

This means

- 2 DPS will be in charge of popping both tank orbs
- 2 DPS will be in charge of popping both healer orbs
- 2 Healers will be in charge of popping two DPS orbs
- 2 Tanks will be in charge of popping two DPS orbs

It's important to note that tanks and healers will **ALWAYS** receive the **Acting-DPS** debuff, while only two DPS will receive the **Acting-Healer** and the other two receiving **Acting-Tank**.  It is random which DPS receive their roles.

In this guide, I'll present two ways of setting up for this mechanic and handling the popping of the orbs. I do not feel that either solution has an advantage over the other in terms of uptime or saftey.

## Party Finder Strat (Text Guide)
In this solution, once the **Acting-[Role]** debuffs have gone out, party members will position themselves around the boss in the following manner:

- Ryu will take the North spot
- Gigren will take the North East spot
- Sock will take the East spot
- Muggy will take the South East spot
- Ethernity will take the South spot
- Edrael will take the South West spot
- Kanae will take the West spot
- Gon will take the North West spot

We can use static positions as such and sorta ignore the **Acting-[Role]** debuffs

The following image shows the placement of all party members.

Doing the positions this way will group the tanks, ranged dps, healers, and melee dps together at specific points around the boss. Then when the orbs spawn, each partner group just has to run through the boss together to pop first orbs at the cardinals, then rotate clockwise together to pop the orbs at the intercardinals. Doing it this way puts the first orb pops with

- Tanks popping South orb
- Healer popping East orb
- Melee DPS popping North orb
- Ranged DPS popping West orb
