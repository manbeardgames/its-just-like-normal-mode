## Belone Coil (Overview)
When the boss uses **Belone Coil** four meteor circles will spawn in the middle of the arena.  These circles will have either  **No DPS** markers or a **No Tanks and No Healer** markers.  These markers indicate which roles cannot stand in the towers to soak the meteors.  If it is the **No DPS** marker then the tanks and healers (supports) will need to stand in the towers.  If it is the **No Tank and No Healer** markers, then the DPS will need to stand in the towers.

Along with the towers, the boss will tether four random party members that, when resolved, will hit those party members with a point blank AoE.  The party members that are not getting the towers need to be the ones to grab the tethers and pull them away from the group.

## Uptime Strat
For the uptime strat, the main tank needs to pull the boss to the north wall of the arena, the rest of the party will stack behind the boss.  Once the towers appear, those that need to move into the towers do so with melee/tanks taking the north towers and the ranged/healers taking the south towers.  The party members not getting towers will need to move into the center of the boss's hitbox to grab the tethers then spread them out as shown in the images below; melee/tanks on the north intercardinals of the boss, ranged/healers further out on the left and right side of the boss.
