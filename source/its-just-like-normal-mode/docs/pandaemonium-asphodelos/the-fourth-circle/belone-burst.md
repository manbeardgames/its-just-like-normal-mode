## Belone Burst (Overview)
**Belone Burst** is the name of the mechanic that is the second part of a two part mechanic. The first part is called **Vengeful Belone**.  During this, players will be marked with an **Acting-[Role]** debuff where [Role] is either Tank, Healer or DPS. Then eight orbs will spawn around the arena, tethering to the closest player to them.  Each orb is designated a role based on the role of the person it tethers too, so an orb tethered to a tank is a tank orb, an orb tethered to a dps is a dps orb, etc.  

All 8 orbs must be popped and soaked by two party members each and will do a small AoE explosion around them when they are popped. Not only this, but party members can only pop an orb that is of a role differing from the **Acting-[Role]** debuff that they have recieved.  

This means

- 2 DPS will be in charge of popping both tank orbs
- 2 DPS will be in charge of popping both healer orbs
- 2 Healers will be in charge of popping two DPS orbs
- 2 Tanks will be in charge of popping two DPS orbs

It's important to note that tanks and healers will **ALWAYS** receive the **Acting-DPS** debuff, while only two DPS will receive the **Acting-Healer** and the other two receiving **Acting-Tank**.  It is random which DPS receive their roles.

In this guide, I'll present two ways of setting up for this mechanic and handling the popping of the orbs. I do not feel that either solution has an advantage over the other in terms of uptime or saftey.

## Mario Kart Orbs (Text Guide)
In this solution, once the **Acting-[Role]** debuffs have gone out, party members will position themselves around the boss in the following manner:

- Tanks will stand North and North East of the boss
- Healers will stand South and South West of the boss
- The two DPS with the **Acting-Healer** debuff will stand East and South East of the boss
- The two DPS with the **Acting-Tank** debuff will stand West and North West of the boss.

The following image shows the placement of all party members.

Doing the positions this way puts every **Acting-[Role]** debuff with a partner and lines them up so that the orbs they need to pop and soak together will the the two orbs that spawn clockwise from their positions.  In this mannar, all party members will need to just simply rotate around the room clockwise with their partner and pop the orbs they need to.
