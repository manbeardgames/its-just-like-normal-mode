## Applying Video To Our Group
### Act I Notes
For Act 1, we will have the following light parties and priorities
- Tanks and Healers will go to the **North** or **East** sides depending on which is safe first
- DPS will go to the **South** and **West** sides depending on which is safe first.
- Tanks will take the close towers on their side and healers far towers
- Melee DPS will take the close towers on their side and ranged far towers.

Setup for both scenarios shown below.  Click to expand the one you want to see

### Act II Notes
The final 2 DPS that need to stretch their fire tethers outs, one has to go clockwise and the other counterclockwise.  To determine which goes in which direction, we'll reuse our priority system from phase 1 where we determined who moved in to get the virus debuff.  Who ever has higher priority will go **clockwise** and the lower priority will go **counterclockwise**

To note the priority from top-to-bottom, highest priority to lowest priority it is 

1. Muggy
2. Edrael
3. Ethernity
4. Sock

### Act IV Notes
After resolving the party member with the light indicator over their heads, the party will move to the North side of the arena as the starting point to resolve the purple indicator tether. We'll rotate clockwise around the boss to resolve the remaining tethers.

This means with the party stacking North, the player tethered to the South thorn will be the first to break their tether.

### Act V Notes
We will use the same spread positions that we used during Act I for tower positions (Tanks/Melee close, Healers/Ranged far)
