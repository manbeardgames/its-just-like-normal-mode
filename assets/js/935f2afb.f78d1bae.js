So for a quick overview of whats happening, the boss will absorb the aether from four party members, two sepearte times.  The mechanics that follow will then reuse the aether he absorded to deal damage. The mechanics has to be resolved in such a way that when if a party member is handling a mechanic, it is for one that their aether is not being used on.","sidebar":"p4sSidebar"},"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/p4s-pinax":{"id":"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/p4s-pinax","title":"Pinax (Tiles)","description":"Pinax (Overview)","sidebar":"p4sSidebar"},"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/the-fourth-circle-savage":{"id":"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-fourth-circle/the-fourth-circle-savage","title":"Overview","description":"Description","sidebar":"p4sSidebar"},"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-third-circle/p3s-adds":{"id":"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-third-circle/p3s-adds","title":"Adds Phase","description":"During the adds phase, the party will need to be split up into two light parties consiting of one tank, one healer, and two dps each.
