Which one is being used is based on the animation from the boss.  If a single large ball of fire spawns on the boss and flys upward, it is the Large Fireplume variation.  If, instead, it is several small fire balls that spawn around the boss and then fly up, it is the Small Fireplumes variation.","sidebar":"p3sSidebar"},"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-third-circle/p3s-heat-of-condemnation":{"id":"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-third-circle/p3s-heat-of-condemnation","title":"Heat of Condemnation","description":"This will spawn two tethers on a random non-tank party member.  When the mechanic resolves, the players that are being targeted with the tethers will receive heavy hitting tank busters and also create an explosion AoE around them.  To resolve this mechanic, first party members should stack behind the boss.  This allows both tethers to be going to the same general location.  Next, the tanks will need to move in and grab the tethers from the party members, then take them to the opposite side of the boss, away from each other, for the resolution.","sidebar":"p3sSidebar"},"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-third-circle/p3s-left-right-cinderwing":{"id":"pandaemonium-asphodelos/the-third-circle/p3s-left-right-cinderwing","title":"Left/Right Cinderwing","description":"The boss will do a half room cleave on the side denoted by the cast name.
